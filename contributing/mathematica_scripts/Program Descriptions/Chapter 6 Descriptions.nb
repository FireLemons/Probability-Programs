                    Mathematica-Compatible Notebook

This notebook can be used on any computer system with Mathematica 3.0,
MathReader 3.0, or any compatible application. The data for the notebook 
starts with the line of stars above.

To get the notebook into a Mathematica-compatible application, do one of 
the following:

* Save the data starting with the line of stars above into a file
  with a name ending in .nb, then open the file inside the application;

* Copy the data starting with the line of stars above to the
  clipboard, then use the Paste menu command inside the application.

Data for notebooks contains only printable 7-bit ASCII and can be
sent directly in email or through ftp in text mode.  Newlines can be
CR, LF or CRLF (Unix, Macintosh or MS-DOS style).

NOTE: If you modify the data for this notebook not in a Mathematica-
compatible application, you must delete the line below containing the 
word CacheID, otherwise Mathematica-compatible applications may try to 
use invalid cache data.

applications, contact Wolfram Research:

  "\n\n\nPROGRAM:  Craps\nCALLING SEQUENCE:  Craps[n]\nPARAMETERS:\n     n - \
an integer\nSYNOPSIS:\n     -  This program simulates n plays of the game of \
craps, with a bet of one dollar\n         being made for each game.  The \
program prints out the average number of\n         winnings per game.\n\
RETURNED VALUES:\n     - none\nLOCATION:\n     Folder:  Chapter 6\n     File: \
      \"Craps.Chpt6.mat\"\n     \n     \nPROGRAM:  Die\nCALLING SEQUENCE:  \
Die[n, s]\nPARAMETERS:\n     n, s - integers\nSYNOPSIS:\n     -  This program \
simulates the following experiment n times: an s-sided die is\n         \
rolled.  If an odd number turns up, an amount equal to that number is won; if \
an\n         even number turns up, an amount equal to that number is lost.  \
The program\n         displays the frequency and the relative frequency with \
which each outcome\n         occurs, as well as displaying the average gain \
over the n trials.\nRETURNED VALUES:\n     -  the average gain over the n \
trials\nLOCATION:\n     Folder:  Chapter 6\n     File:      \"Die.Chpt6.mat\"\
\n     \n\nPROGRAM:  StockSystem\nCALLING SEQUENCE:  StockSystem[n]\n\
PARAMETERS:\n     n - an integer\nSYNOPSIS:\n     -  This program simulates \
Mr. Ace's playing of the stock market, as described in the\n        book, \
where he must stop after n days.  Without loss of generality, we let the\n    \
    book's V = 0.  The program prints out and returns Mr. Ace's net gain \
after the n\n        days, and plots the points (x, f(x)) for x = 0 to n, \
where x is the number of the day,\n        and f(x) is the value of V on day \
x.  The points are connected with lines:  dotted\n        lines indicate time \
during which Mr. Ace holds stock under his system; unbroken\n        lines \
indicate time during which he does not hold stock.\nRETURNED VALUES:\n     -  \
