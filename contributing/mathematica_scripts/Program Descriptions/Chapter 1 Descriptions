CHAPTER 1 PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS


PROGRAM:  CoinTosses
CALLING SEQUENCE:  CoinTosses[n, print]
PARAMETERS:  
     n - an integer
     print - a Boolean variable (True or False)
SYNOPSIS:   
     - This program simulates n tosses of a fair coin, and prints the proportion of tosses
        that come up heads.  If print = True,  then the outcomes of the tosses (H/T) are
        also printed.
RETURNED VALUES:
     -  none         
LOCATION:
     Folder:  Chapter 1
     File:       "CoinTosses.Chpt1.mat"
     
         		                   
PROGRAM:  DeMere1
CALLING SEQUENCE:   DeMere1[n, print] 
PARAMETERS: 
     n - an integer
     print - a Boolean variable (True or False)
SYNOPSIS:   
     - This program simulates 4 rolls of a die, and determines whether a six has
        appeared (a "success").  It repeats this experiment n times, and prints the number
        of trials that resulted in a success.  It also prints the proportion of trials that
        resulted in a success.   Finally, if print = True, then the rolls are printed out.
 RETURNED VALUES:
     -  none
LOCATION:
     Folder:  Chapter 1

PROGRAM:  DeMere2
CALLING SEQUENCE:   DeMere2[n, m, print]
PARAMETERS:  
     n, m - integers
		   print - a Boolean variable (True or False)
SYNOPSIS:   
     - This program simulates m rolls of two dice, and determines whether a double 6 	
       has appeared (a "success").  It repeats this experiment n times, and prints the
       number of trials that resulted in a success.  It also prints the proportion of trials
       that resulted in a success.   Finally, if print = True, then the rolls are printed out.
RETURNED VALUES:
     -  none

PROGRAM:  GeneralSimulation
CALLING SEQUENCE:  GeneralSimulation[n, plist, m, print]
PARAMETERS:  
     n, m - integers
     plist - a probability list
     print - a Boolean variable (True or False)
SYNOPSIS:
     -  This program simulates a general experiment in which the outcomes 1, 2, ..., n
        occur with probabilties p(1), p(2), ..., p(n).  These probabilities are entered as a
        list in plist.  The experiment is repeated m times, and the observed frequencies of
        the outcomes are printed.  If print = True, the outcomes are printed, and spike
        graphs of the observed data frequencies and  plist data frequencies are
        displayed on the same set of axes;  the observed data spikes are topped with
        blue dots, and the plist data spikes are topped with red.  Finally, the program
        returns a list of the n observed frequencies.
      -  Note:  this program requires the programs "SimulateDiscreteVariable[plist]" and
         "SpikegraphWithDots[distributionlist, xmin, xmax, color, print]" be initialized.
RETURNED VALUES:
     -  a list of the n observed frequencies

PROGRAM:  HorseRace
CALLING SEQUENCE:  HorseRace[n]
PARAMETERS:  
     n - an integer
SYNOPSIS:
     - This program simulates n of the horse races described in Chapter 1.  The
       program prints each race winner, and returns a list containing the percentage of
       times each horse won. 
RETURNED VALUES:
     -  a list containing the number of times each horse won

FUNCTION:  HTSimulation
CALLING SEQUENCE:  HTSimulation[n, m, print]
PARAMETERS:  
     n, m - integers
     print - a Boolean variable (True or False)
 SYNOPSIS:
     -  This program simulates an experiment in which a fair coin is tossed m times. 
        The experiment is repeated n times.  The program records the "winnings" in each
        experiment, where the winnings are defined to be the number of heads minus
        the number of tails.  It also keeps track of thenumber of times the winnings are
        "positive" in the course of an experiment (we count as "positive" a time at which
        the winnings are 0 but the previous winnings are positive).   The program returns
        a list whose first element is a list of the winnings in each experiment
        (winningslist), and whose second element is a list of times in the lead in each
        experiment (timesinleadlist).  If print = True and n = 1, then a graph of the game
        is displayed.  If print = True and n > 1, then spike graphs of the winningslist
        and timesinleadlist are displayed. 
     -  Note:  this program requires the program "Spikegraph[distributionlist, xmin,
        xmax, print]" be initialized.
RETURNED VALUES:
     -  a list whose first element is a list of the winnings in each experiment, and whose
        second element is a list of times in the lead in each experiment

PROGRAM:   RandomNumbers
CALLING SEQUENCE:   RandomNumbers[n] 
PARAMETERS:  
      n - an integer
SYNOPSIS: 
      - This program generates and displays n random real numbers between 0  and
         1.
RETURNED VALUES:
      - none
